# Canadian-GPA-and-Grade-Calculator-Android-App
## Description 
This app supports GPAâ€™s for every Canadian University. In addition, the app also includes a grade calculator to calculate your grade in a course or to calculate what grade you need to get assignments and finals to achieve your desired final grade. 
## Motivation
I created this project to create an app that gives students a simple to use tool to calculate their GPA, marks in courses, and marks before major evaluations. This app will eliminate students needing to search the web for their school's Grade Point Scale and then again to calculate their Grade Point Average and Course Marks. 
## Build Status
Finished with no plan to expand at this time. 
## Navigation
The app was created using Android Studio. Hence, the Java files can be found in *Canadian-GPA-and-Grade-Calculator-Android-App/app/src/main/java/com/gradeCalculator/gradeandgpacalculator/*, and the XML files in *Canadian-GPA-and-Grade-Calculator-Android-App/app/src/main/res/layout/*.
## Style
When reading the code you will immediately notice the app was created with an object orientated approach that provides great encapsulation of objects like Grade, GradeCalculator, and GPACalculator to name a few. In addition, each object has high cohesion and relativly low coupling.
## Installation
You can install the app through the google play store at the following URL https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gradeCalculator.gradeandgpacalculator&hl=en
