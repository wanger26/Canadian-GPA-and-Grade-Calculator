# Canadian-GPA-and-Grade-Calculator-Android-App
## Description 
This app supports GPAâ€™s for every Canadian University. In addition, the app also includes a grade calculator to calculate your grade in a course or to calculate what grade you need to get assignments and finals to achieve your desired final grade. 
## Navigation
The app was created using Android Studio. Hence, the Java files can be found in *Canadian-GPA-and-Grade-Calculator-Android-App/app/src/main/java/com/gradeCalculator/gradeandgpacalculator/*, and the XML files in *Canadian-GPA-and-Grade-Calculator-Android-App/app/src/main/res/layout/*.
## Style
When reading the code you will immediately notice the app was created with an object orientated approach that provides great encapsulation of objects like Grade, GradeCalculator, and GPACalculator to name a few. In addition, each object has high cohesion and relativly low coupling.
